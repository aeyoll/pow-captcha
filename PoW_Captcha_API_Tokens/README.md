# PoW_Captcha_API_Tokens folder

ðŸ’¥PoW! Captcha will store API tokens here. You may place this folder either in the current working directory from which the application is started, or you may place it next to the application binary. 

If you run ðŸ’¥PoW! Captcha in a linux container, you will want to mount this folder to a persistent volume so you don't lose your API tokens when you upgrade the container to a new image!
